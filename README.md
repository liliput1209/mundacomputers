This project aims to create a website for a computer coaching class that provides educational programs for students as well as a range of commercial services for clients. The website will feature detailed information about various courses, including programming, web development, and software training. Additionally, it will offer commercial services such as data analysis, IT consulting, and software development. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, allowing easy navigation and access to information, helping both students and clients find the services they need quickly and efficiently.
